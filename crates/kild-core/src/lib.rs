//! kild-core: Core library for parallel AI agent worktree management
//!
//! This library provides the business logic for managing kilds (isolated

//! # Main Entry Points
//!
//! - [`sessions`] - Create, list, destroy, restart sessions
//! - [`health`] - Monitor kild health and metrics
//! - [`cleanup`] - Clean up orphaned resources
