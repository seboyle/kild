# KILD

Manage parallel AI development agents in isolated Git worktrees.

## Overview

KILD eliminates context switching between scattered terminals when working with multiple AI coding assistants. Each kild runs in its own Git worktree with automatic branch creation, allowing you to manage parallel AI development sessions from a centralized interface.

## Features

- **Isolated Worktrees**: Each kild gets its own Git worktree with unique `kild_<hash>` branch
- **Native Terminal Integration**: Launches AI agents in native terminal windows
- **Session Tracking**: Persistent registry tracks all active kilds
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows
- **Agent-Friendly**: Designed for programmatic use by AI assistants

## GUI (Experimental)

A native graphical interface is under development using GPUI. The UI provides visual kild management as an alternative to the CLI.

```bash
# Build and run the experimental GPUI GUI
cargo run -p kild-ui
```

The GUI currently supports:
- Multi-project management: Add git repositories as projects, switch between them
- KILD listing with status indicators (running, stopped, git dirty state)
- Creating new kilds with agent selection
- Opening new agents in existing kilds
- Stopping agents without destroying kilds
- Destroying kilds with confirmation dialog
- Bulk operations: Open All stopped kilds, Stop All running kilds
- Quick actions: Copy path to clipboard, open in editor, focus terminal window

See the [PRD](.claude/PRPs/prds/gpui-native-terminal-ui.prd.md) for the development roadmap.

## Installation

```bash
cargo install --path .
```

## Usage

### Global flags

```bash
# Suppress JSON log output (show only user-facing output)
kild -q <command>
kild --quiet <command>
```

### Create a new kild
```bash
kild create <branch> --agent <agent>

# Examples:
kild create kiro-session --agent kiro
kild create claude-work --agent claude
kild create gemini-task --agent gemini

# Add a description with --note
kild create feature-auth --agent claude --note "Implementing JWT authentication"
```

### List active kilds
```bash
kild list

# Machine-readable JSON output
kild list --json
```

### Navigate to a kild (shell integration)
```bash
# Print worktree path
kild cd <branch>

# Shell function for quick navigation
kcd() { cd "$(kild cd "$1")"; }

# Usage with shell function
kcd my-branch
```

### Open a new agent in an existing kild
```bash
# Open with same agent (additive - doesn't close existing terminals)
kild open <branch>

# Open with different agent
kild open <branch> --agent <agent>

# Open agents in all stopped kilds
kild open --all

# Open all stopped kilds with specific agent
kild open --all --agent <agent>
```

### Open kild in code editor
```bash
# Open worktree in editor (uses $EDITOR or defaults to 'zed')
kild code <branch>

# Use specific editor
kild code <branch> --editor vim
```

### Focus on a kild
```bash
# Bring terminal window to foreground
kild focus <branch>
```

### View git changes in a kild
```bash
# Show uncommitted changes
kild diff <branch>

# Show only staged changes
kild diff <branch> --staged
```

### Show recent commits
```bash
# Show last 10 commits (default)
kild commits <branch>

# Show last 5 commits
kild commits <branch> -n 5
kild commits <branch> --count 5
```

### Stop a kild
```bash
# Stop agent, preserve worktree
kild stop <branch>

# Stop all running kilds
kild stop --all
```

### Get kild information
```bash
kild status <branch>

# Machine-readable JSON output
kild status <branch> --json
```

### Destroy a kild
```bash
kild destroy <branch>

# Force destroy (bypass git uncommitted changes check)
kild destroy <branch> --force

# Destroy all kilds (with confirmation prompt)
kild destroy --all

# Force destroy all (skip confirmation and git checks)
kild destroy --all --force
```

### Note on deprecated commands

The `restart` command is deprecated. Use `open` instead:
```bash
# Old (deprecated, still works with warning)
kild restart <branch>

# New (preferred)
kild open <branch>
```

### Clean up orphaned kilds
```bash
kild cleanup
```

## How It Works

1. **Worktree Creation**: Creates a new Git worktree in `.kild/<name>` with a unique branch
2. **Agent Launch**: Launches the specified agent command in a native terminal window
3. **Session Tracking**: Records session metadata in `~/.kild/registry.json`
4. **Lifecycle Management**: Provides commands to monitor, stop, and clean up sessions

## Requirements

- Rust 1.89.0 or later
- Git repository (kild must be run from within a Git repository)
- Native terminal emulator (Terminal.app on macOS, gnome-terminal/konsole on Linux, etc.)

## Agent Integration

KILD is designed to be used by AI agents themselves. For example, an AI assistant can create a new kild for a specific task:

```bash
# AI agent creates isolated workspace for bug fix
kild create bug-fix-123 --agent claude
```

This enables parallel AI workflows without manual terminal management.

## Architecture

- **CLI**: Built with clap for structured command parsing
- **Git Operations**: Uses git2 crate for worktree management
- **Terminal Launching**: Platform-specific terminal integration
- **Session Registry**: JSON-based persistent storage
- **Cross-Platform**: Conditional compilation for platform features
